# Version 99 Does Not Exist

Please see [my blog]("http://day-to-day-stuff.blogspot.com/2007/10/announcement-version-99-does-not-exist.html)
to read why I created Version 99 Does Not Exist and its predecessor no-commons-logging.

Version 99 Does Not Exist emulates a Maven 2 repository and serves empty jars for any valid package that has version number *99.0-does-not-exist*. It also generates poms and of course the appropriate hashes.

For example the following links will give an [empty har](http://version99.grons.nl/mvn2/commons-logging/commons-logging/99.0-does-not-exist/commons-logging-99.0-does-not-exist.jar), its [pom](http://version99.grons.nl/mvn2/commons-logging/commons-logging/99.0-does-not-exist/commons-logging-99.0-does-not-exist.pom) for commons-logging.</p>

The original Ruby/Camping application was ported to Go by my colleague Frank Schroeders.
